Delta SkyMiles Earning Structure (2025)
Redeemable SkyMiles Earn Rates on Delta Flights

On Delta-operated flights (Delta-marketed, DL-coded tickets), SkyMiles are earned based on the fare amount paid (excluding taxes/fees) and the member’s Medallion status. Base rate for a general SkyMiles member is 5 SkyMiles per $1 spent on the base fare for Main Cabin or higher fares

. In contrast, Basic Economy tickets (branded as Delta Main Basic) earn no SkyMiles at all
content.delta.com
. Medallion elite members earn bonus miles on top of the base 5x rate, as follows
content.delta.com
:

Silver Medallion: 7 SkyMiles per $1 (2x bonus over the base 5x)

Gold Medallion: 8 SkyMiles per $1 (3x bonus)

Platinum Medallion: 9 SkyMiles per $1 (4x bonus)

Diamond Medallion: 11 SkyMiles per $1 (6x bonus)

(All mileage accrual is calculated on the base fare plus any carrier-imposed surcharges, excluding government-imposed taxes and fees

Earning Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) on Delta Flights

Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) measure your qualifying spend on Delta flights toward Medallion status. For Delta-operated flights, MQDs are essentially earned $1 per $1 spent on the ticket’s base fare and carrier-imposed surcharges (i.e. the airfare price before taxes)

. In other words, if you pay $500 for a Delta ticket (excluding taxes), you earn 500 MQDs. If a ticket is purchased in foreign currency, the fare is converted to USD at standard exchange rates for MQD credit
delta.com
. Example: a $478 ticket including $64 in taxes would yield $414 MQDs (since taxes don’t count)
americanexpress.com
.

What counts toward MQDs: Only the fare costs of Delta-marketed flights in Main Cabin (Classic) or higher classes count toward MQDs
delta.com
. If you pay for an upgrade (e.g. purchasing a Comfort+ seat or premium cabin upgrade through Delta), those upgrade fees are generally treated as additional fare and earn MQDs as well
delta.com
delta.com
. What does not count: Government taxes and airport fees are excluded from MQDs
delta.com
. Additionally, Basic Economy fares earn 0 MQDs – they do not contribute to status at all
content.delta.com
. Other ancillary fees and purchases (bag fees, seat selection fees, ticket change fees, Sky Club memberships, in-flight food/Wi-Fi, etc.) do not count toward MQDs
delta.com
. MQDs are credited to the account of the passenger flying (regardless of who purchased the ticket) and are posted after travel is completed

MQD Earning via Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards (2025)

Delta’s co-branded American Express credit cards offer MQD boosts to help reach Medallion status. In 2025, only the SkyMiles Platinum and Reserve Amex cards (personal and business versions) provide MQD-earning benefits
delta.com
:

Delta SkyMiles Platinum Amex: Comes with an automatic $2,500 MQD “Headstart” each Medallion Qualification Year
delta.com
. Additionally, Platinum cardholders earn 1 MQD for every $20 in eligible spending on the card (this is the MQD Boost benefit)
delta.com
. (For example, $1,000 in spend = 50 MQDs.)

Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex: Comes with a $2,500 MQD Headstart each year as well
delta.com
. Reserve cardholders earn 1 MQD for every $10 in purchases on the card – twice the rate of the Platinum (i.e. $1,000 spend = 100 MQDs)
delta.com
.

Key details: The $2,500 MQD Headstart from these cards is awarded each calendar year to jump-start your status earning
delta.com
. If a member holds multiple eligible cards (e.g. both a Platinum and Reserve, or personal and business versions), each card’s $2,500 MQD headstart applies – potentially providing a combined MQD boost (e.g. holding all four Platinum/Reserve variants would give $10,000 MQDs head start)
frequentmiler.com
frequentmiler.com
. The MQD Boost (spending earn) has no explicit cap beyond your ability to spend; every dollar of card spend will continue accruing MQDs at the stated rate, and these MQDs are added to your annual total for status qualification. (Note: MQDs earned via card spend are only counted within the qualification year and reset to zero at the start of each year, just like flight-earned MQDs
delta.com
. Lower-tier Delta Amex cards – Gold, Blue, etc. – do not earn MQDs via spending or offer headstarts

.)

2025 Medallion Status MQD Requirements

To achieve each Medallion elite tier in the 2025 program (for status through January 2026), a member must earn the following MQD thresholds (there are no longer any Medallion Qualifying Miles or segment requirements – status is solely MQD-based):

Silver Medallion: $5,000 MQDs
thepointsguy.com

Gold Medallion: $10,000 MQDs
thepointsguy.com

Platinum Medallion: $15,000 MQDs
thepointsguy.com

Diamond Medallion: $28,000 MQDs
thepointsguy.com

These are the MQD totals needed within a calendar year to earn the status. The MQD Headstart from a Platinum/Reserve credit card ($2,500) effectively counts toward these totals – for example, a Platinum cardholder starts the year at $2,500 MQD, needing an additional $2,500 of flight spend to reach Silver’s $5,000
thepointsguy.com
. There is no “MQD waiver” via credit card spend anymore; instead, the above-listed MQD earning from cards directly contributes to reaching these thresholds (e.g. a Reserve cardholder could theoretically attain Silver Medallion entirely via $25k card spend, which yields $2.5k headstart + $2.5k from spend = $5k MQD)

Fare Type Impact on SkyMiles & MQD Earnings (Basic Economy vs. Main Cabin)

Fare class matters for earning: Delta differentiates Basic Economy from all other fare types when it comes to earning miles and status credit. Basic Economy (Delta Main Basic) tickets do not earn any redeemable SkyMiles and do not earn MQDs or any Medallion qualifying credit
content.delta.com
. This policy applies regardless of Medallion status – even elite members receive 0 credit for Basic Economy flights. By contrast, all other standard fare types – Main Cabin (Classic), Comfort+, Premium Select, First Class, Delta One – earn miles and MQDs at the normal rates (5x base miles per $1, with status bonuses as applicable, and 1 MQD per $1 spent)
content.delta.com
delta.com
. In practical terms, higher fare classes don’t get a higher multiplier, but because they generally have higher prices, they yield more total miles/MQDs due to the revenue-based earning formula.

Summary: To maximize SkyMiles and MQD earnings on Delta-operated flights, travelers should book Main Cabin or higher fares. **Basic Economy is essentially “no-frills” with respect to SkyMiles – it yields 0 miles, 0 MQDs and thus does not contribute to elite status qualification
content.delta.com
content.delta.com
. (Basic Economy passengers also forgo other perks like upgrades and seat selection, underscoring that these fares trade away loyalty credits for a lower price.) All other paid Delta fares will accrue redeemable SkyMiles and MQDs normally, calculated on the ticket base price. This structure mirrors Delta’s revenue-based earning approach used by other major U.S. carriers, while uniquely requiring only MQDs for status in 2025 (no MQM/miles or segments requirement)
