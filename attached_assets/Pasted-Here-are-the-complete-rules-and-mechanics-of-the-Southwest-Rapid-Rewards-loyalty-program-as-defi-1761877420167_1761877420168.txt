Here are the **complete rules and mechanics of the Southwest Rapid Rewards loyalty program** as defined in the calculator and supporting research files you shared. This includes all **point-earning logic, tier qualification rules, credit card interactions, and companion pass tracking**.

---

## 🧭 PROGRAM STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Southwest Rapid Rewards operates across **three primary currencies**:

1. **RR Points (Redeemable Rewards)** – used for booking flights, hotels, or other redemptions.
2. **CQP (Companion Qualifying Points)** – count toward earning the **Companion Pass**.
3. **TQP (Tier Qualifying Points)** – count toward earning **A-List and A-List Preferred** status.

All points are tied to **spend** (not miles flown) and vary by **fare type, elite status, and credit card**.

## 🪙 POINTS EARNED FROM FLIGHTS

### 1. Base Earn Rate by Fare Type

| Fare Type        | RR Points / $1 | CQP per $1 | TQP per $1 |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Basic            | 2              | 2          | 2          |
| Choice           | 6              | 6          | 6          |
| Choice Preferred | 10             | 10         | 10         |
| Choice Extra     | 14             | 14         | 14         |

*(Values from Calculator reference rows 25–28)*

### 2. Tier Status Bonus (on base fare only)

| Tier             | RR Bonus | CQP Bonus | TQP Bonus |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| No Status        | +0%      | 0         | 0         |
| A-List           | +25% RR  | 0         | 0         |
| A-List Preferred | +100% RR | 0         | 0         |

*(Rows 31–33)*

> 💡 **Example:**
> A-List Preferred member buying a $300 Choice Extra fare earns 14 × $300 × 2.0 = 8,400 RR points (including bonus).

---

### 3. Total Flight Earn Formula

```
Total Flight RR = (Base Fare × Fare Multiplier) × (1 + Tier Bonus %)
Total Flight CQP = Base Fare × Fare Multiplier
Total Flight TQP = Base Fare × Fare Multiplier
```

Only **base** flight points count toward tier or companion qualification.

## 🤝 PARTNER POINTS

* Hotel, car, dining, and shopping partners can contribute **RR points** and **CQP** (not TQP).
* Entered manually as *Partner Points (D21)* in calculator.

---

## 🧾 QUALIFICATION THRESHOLDS

| Tier / Award         | Flights | CQP     | TQP    |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| **A-List**           | 20      | n/a     | 35,000 |
| **A-List Preferred** | 40      | n/a     | 70,000 |
| **Companion Pass**   | 100     | 135,000 | n/a    |

> Qualification can occur **either** via flights **or** via points thresholds (whichever comes first).

---

## 🏆 COMPANION PASS RULES

* Earned by reaching **135,000 CQP** or **100 qualifying flights** in a calendar year.
* Once achieved, valid for the **remainder of the current year and the full following year**.
* Companion can be changed up to **3 times per year**.
* Sign-up bonuses, credit card spend, and partner activity **count toward Companion Pass**.
* Redeemed points flights **do not** count toward qualification.

## 🧮 RETURN ON SPEND (ROS)

Using average redemption value **1.4¢ per RR point**, calculator computes:

```
Value of RR Points = Total RR Points × 0.014
Return on Spend = Value of RR / (Flight Spend + Card Spend + Annual Card Fee)
```

This isolates the **financial return percentage** of participating in Rapid Rewards given chosen behaviors.

---

## 🧰 QUALIFICATION LOGIC (simplified from formulas)

1. **A-List** = IF(Flights ≥ 20 OR TQP ≥ 35,000) → “Qualified”
2. **A-List Preferred** = IF(Flights ≥ 40 OR TQP ≥ 70,000) → “Qualified”
3. **Companion Pass** = IF(Flights ≥ 100 OR CQP ≥ 135,000) → “Qualified”

---

## 💡 PROGRAM DESIGN INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH FILES

* **Top motivators** to pursue status:

  1. **Companion Pass**
  2. **Seat selection / priority boarding**
  3. **Adjacent seat certificate (blocked middle seat)**
  4. **Free checked bags**

* **Elite Point Boosts** (e.g., 10,000 rollover points) tested well as “nice to have” but not as primary motivators.

* **Credit card synergies** drive engagement: cardholders are 2–3× more likely to strive for status benefits.

* **A-List Preferred members** value **Wi-Fi, dedicated support, and time-savers** most.

## ✅ SUMMARY: RULES IN PLAIN LANGUAGE

1. **Earn Rapid Rewards points** on flights, credit card purchases, and partners.
2. **Qualify for tiers** via **TQP** (A-List tiers) or **CQP** (Companion Pass).
3. **All flight points** count toward CQP/TQP; **credit card spend** counts toward CQP and limited TQP boosts.
4. **Annual bonuses** from cards add lump-sum points that also count toward qualification.
5. **Tier bonuses** amplify RR points but not CQP/TQP.
6. **Thresholds reset each calendar year**.
7. **Points never expire** and redemption has no blackout dates.
8. **Companion Pass** remains the ultimate reward—most motivating benefit in customer testing.
