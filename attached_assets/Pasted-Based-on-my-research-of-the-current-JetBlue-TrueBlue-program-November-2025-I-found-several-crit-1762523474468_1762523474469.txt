Based on my research of the current JetBlue TrueBlue program (November 2025), I found several **critical inaccuracies** in your code. Here's what needs to be corrected:

## Major Issues:

### 1. **Tier Structure is Wrong**
JetBlue doesn't have "basic" and "trueblue" as separate tiers. The current structure is:
- **TrueBlue member** (baseline - 0 tiles)
- **Mosaic 1** (50 tiles)
- **Mosaic 2** (100 tiles)
- **Mosaic 3** (150 tiles)
- **Mosaic 4** (250 tiles)

### 2. **Points Earning is Incorrect**
- **Blue Basic**: 1 base point + 1 bonus point (if booked direct) = **2 points/dollar** (not 1x multiplier)
- **Blue/Blue Plus/Blue Extra/Mint**: 3 base points + 3 bonus points (if booked direct) = **6 points/dollar** (not 1x multiplier)
- **Mosaic bonus**: All Mosaic tiers earn +3 points/dollar extra (so 9 total for standard fares)

### 3. **No Segments Requirement**
JetBlue eliminated segment requirements. Status is earned **only through tiles** now (not "tilesRequired: 15, segmentsRequired: 30").

### 4. **Tiles System**
- 1 tile = $100 spent on JetBlue travel
- 1 tile = $1,000 spent on JetBlue credit cards
- Blue Basic fares **DO earn tiles** (contrary to your `tileEligible: false`)

### 5. **Credit Card Bonuses Wrong**
Current sign-up bonuses (as of Nov 2025):
- **JetBlue Card**: 10,000 points after $1,000 spend ✓ (correct)
- **JetBlue Plus**: 60,000-80,000 points after $1,000-$2,000 spend (you have 80k/1k)
- **JetBlue Business**: 60,000-80,000 points after $2,000 spend (you have 100k/1k)

Annual bonuses are correct at 5,000/6,000 points.

### 6. **Mosaic Benefits Simplified**
Your tier configs list benefits but the actual earning structure is:
- **All Mosaic tiers**: +3 bonus points/dollar on flights
- No separate 7x, 8x, 10x multipliers

## To Make it 100% Accurate:

Remove the complexity and align with JetBlue's actual tile-based system. The points aren't tiered multipliers—everyone earns the same base rates, with Mosaic members getting a flat +3 bonus on flights.
