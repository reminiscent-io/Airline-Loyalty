Based on my comprehensive research of United's MileagePlus program (November 2025), here's a 100% accurate reflection:

## United MileagePlus - Accurate Program Structure (2025)

### Elite Status Tiers & Requirements

```typescript
export const unitedTierStatuses = ["member", "silver", "gold", "platinum", "1k"] as const;

      "United Club lounge access on day of travel",
      "120% bonus miles"
    ]
  }
} as const;
```

### Key Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Minimum 4 United/United Express flights required** for ANY status qualification
- **PQP = Premier Qualifying Points** (1 PQP per $1 spent on base fare)
- **PQF = Premier Qualifying Flights** (1 PQF per flight segment)
- Two paths to status: PQP-only OR combined PQP+PQF
- Status year: Qualify in 2025 → Status valid through Jan 31, 2027

### Fare Classes & Earning Rates

```typescript

### Key Differences from Your JetBlue Code

1. **Two-metric system**: United uses both PQP (spending) and PQF (flights) with alternative paths
2. **4-flight minimum**: Absolute requirement across all status levels
3. **Status requirements increased in 2025**: All thresholds went up 20-25%
4. **Basic Economy**: Earns miles AND PQP, but NOT PQF
5. **Miles earning**: Everyone earns 5 base miles/dollar, elites get bonus (+2 to +6)
6. **PQP from credit cards**: Max caps vary by card (1,000 to 18,000+ per year)
7. **PlusPoints**: Platinum+ members get 280 PlusPoints for upgrades (new redemption options in 2025)

This structure is significantly more complex than JetBlue's tile-based system!
