### Key Clarifications

**Is Status Earning Multiplicative or Additive?**
Elite status bonuses are **multiplicative** of your base earning method. Your choice of distance/spend/segment determines base earning, then your elite tier multiplies that by (1 + bonus percentage).[3][5]

**Credit Card Bonus Points Structure**:
- Summit card: **1, 2, 3, or 4 bonus points** depending on category (0 base + 1-3 bonus, or 1 base + 0-2 bonus)
- The "3x" categories mean 3 total points per dollar
- Foreign purchases uniquely earn 3x on the Summit card[33]

**Hawaiian Credit Cards and Status Points**:
The Barclays Hawaiian cards and Bank of Hawaii card do **NOT earn status points** toward elite qualification. They only earn redeemable Atmos points. For status point earning, you need a Bank of America-issued Atmos card (Summit, Ascent, or Business).[29][31]

### Additional 2026 Changes

**Communities**: Choose interest-based communities for personalized perks:[34][10]
- Huaka'i by Hawaiian (Hawaii residents) - 50% bonus on neighbor island travel
- Club 49 (Alaska residents)
- Global Locals (non-US members)
- Culinary Journeys

- Families On the Go

**Free Starlink Wi-Fi**: Rolling out 2026-2027 for all Atmos members (free with T-Mobile partnership)[2][1]

**Upgrade with Points**: New redemption option launching late 2026[35][14]
